# Generating-Turing-Patterns
In this project we are generating Turing patterns using the Swift-Hohenberg Equation and periodic boundary conditions.

Swift Hohenberg equation: $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = a_1 u - b_1 \nabla^2 u - \nabla^4 u + \mathcal{N(u)}$

where, $a_1, b_1$ are coefficients and $\mathcal{N(u)}$ is a non-linear term.
